# TL;DR

* Ask questions and make comments by [filing issues][issue].
* Make pull requests to a `develop-$VERSION$` branch.
* All contributions are licensed under the [VOL][vol].

# Communication

There's not an official chat room or anything
set up yet, so ask questions and make comments
by [creating issues][issue].

You might get linked to a page that answers your
question, and then your issue will get closed. If
you still have questions, go ahead and re-open the
issue--that's okay to do!

If you have suggestions for a good, free, open source
chat mechanism, go ahead and [file an issue][issue]
and propose a solution!

(Someday we'll dogfood the protocol by making the
official chat room use it!)

# Contributing

Here's where you should start:

* You should read through the latest release.
* You should think it through.
* If you have questions, you should ask by [filing issues][issue].

If you feel like you understand the gist of it, it would
be really awesome if you would look at any of the
[open issues][issue] and add your thoughts and opinions.

I am of the opinion that pull requests are the best way to
start discussions about changes, since they force you
to make sure you're thinking about things clearly.

# Writing Words

If you want to make a pull request, that is totally
awesome! Do it! No need to ask permission!

If you just want to fix some misspelling, or grammar,
or bad links, or something similarly non-breaking,
just go ahead and make a [pull request][pull], and
it'll probably get merged in pretty fast.

If you are thinking of making big changes that may
have merge conflicts, or have breaking changes, you
might want to [file an issue][issue] first, and just
ask. Someone else may be working on it already, or
be able to help you. At the very least, bouncing
ideas off someone else is always helpful.

# Pull Requests

Make pull requests to `develop-$VERSION$`, where
`$VERSION$` is the version you want to change.

If your change is non-breaking (like spelling or
grammar corrections), you can make the pull request
against whichever develop branch needs the patch.

If the change is more than that, you can make the
pull request against the newest develop branch.

If there's not a branch with the correct name, go
ahead and [file an issue][issue] to get that made.

Nobody will get offended if you make the pull request
to the wrong branch. If you do, your pull request will
get closed and someone will tell you which branch to use.
