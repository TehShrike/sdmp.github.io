TODO


there is the node journal, how to request it, how to give it as a response, how to broadcast an update to it




the node maintains a journal

the entries of the journal are the posted resources

the index of the journal is a list of the resource identifiers

that list is sent out to other nodes periodically (see network specs)

nodes can request each others journal index, in case they were offline for a while

- request specs
- response specs
