A software and network agnostic protocol for distributing messages
across a cryptographically secure, peer-to-peer network.

---

## Purpose

At its heart the SDMP is just a protocol for machines to
communicate messages to each other, in a secure way that
humans can understand.

If humans can understand it, it's easier to make sure the
secure part is actually secure.

---
